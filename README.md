# drive #3
this is an *(outdated)* github mirror of the soggy cat drive. <br>
mostly a last resort for when google drive is unsustainable. <br>
<sup>shortcut to here: https://drive3.soggy.cat/github / https://drive3.sogfulday.today/github</sup>
<br><br>
you can hotlink github directly: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssoggycat/drive-3/refs/heads/main/soggy%20cat/... for your projects <br>
for less clutter but slightly more load time see https://soggy.larm.es/ (soggy cat every hour ftp)
