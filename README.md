# drive #3
#### heyo!! hey!!!
this is a mirror of the third drive, since github is a more reliable platform for serving files than google drive. you can still check out the google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/14MTq198QE4jI3fCnaP71K2fgt948zmlL)

##### file names
each image has a random self-explanatory name (or an inside joke) assigned for convenience. these are usually really bad and wear out as the time passes so apologies for that..
all of the .jpeg files are renamed to .jpg to be compatible for services that don't allow them. if there are any that i missed then just mention me on [soggy world](https://discord.gg/soggycat)!!

##### quality
there are so many shark images that new ones sometimes get found in the most bizzare places, or might just not be fully processed in the website archives. that's why the uploads here might have really low resolution. check google lens / messages on soggy world, there might be higher quality versions just laying out there

##### image-specific info
*"IT'S SNOWING IT'S SNOWING IT'S SNOWING.png"*
was taken from biscuit's tiktok video and had the file name as the caption. i've included a captionless image <sup>(*gulp* ai cleanup..)</sup> since that one is used more often

*“wire.mp4”*
was ripped from a deleted youtube video named “soggy cat found footage”, that’s why there was a siren going off
it was found by marcus3205, and now replaced with the full quality video
